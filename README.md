# Bulldozer Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the sale prices of bulldozers using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various features related to bulldozer sales. The primary goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the sale prices based on these features.

## Project Description

In this project, we explore the relationship between various features of bulldozers and their sale prices. We employ different machine learning models to predict prices and evaluate their performance using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMLSE). The project emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation in building effective predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. It includes various features such as:

- `SalesID`: Unique identifier for each sale
- `saledate`: Date of the sale
- `MachineID`: Unique identifier for each machine
- `YearMade`: Year the machine was manufactured
- `SalePrice`: The target variable we aim to predict

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: 
   - Load the dataset and explore its structure.
   - Handle missing values and convert categorical variables into numerical formats.

2. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Create new features from existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: 
   - Experiment with various machine learning models.
   - Evaluate model performance using RMLSE.

4. **Final Predictions**: 
   - Select the best-performing model and make predictions on the test set.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the models was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMLSE). This metric provides a measure of how well the model predicts the sale prices, allowing us to compare different models effectively.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we successfully built a predictive model for bulldozer sale prices, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We gained valuable insights into the machine learning workflow, highlighting the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
